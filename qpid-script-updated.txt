PRE SHOW: Fifteen minutes before showtime, Actors will be onstage as if it is backstage. Getting ready. Maybe some mirrors and tables. Some might be doing weird vocal or physical exercises.

JOANIE
Sorry I’m late everyone! My hedgehog was sick!

                                        PICARD (V.O.)
                        Captain's Log, stardate 44741.9.
                        We have arrived at Tagus Three
                        where the Enterprise is to serve
                        as host of the Federation
                        Archeology Council's annual
                        symposium.




        PICARD, intensely studying his monitor screen.


                                        PICARD (V.O.)
                        I look forward to giving
                        tomorrow's keynote address with
                        great anticipation.


        The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.


                                        PICARD
                        Come.


                                        TROI
                        I thought you'd want to know,
                        Captain, the Council members have
                        all been beamed aboard and
                        assigned quarters.


                                        PICARD
                        Excellent.




                                        TROI


                        It really is quite late, Captain.




                                        PICARD
                        Tell me, Counselor, in regard
                        to my lecture, which do you
                        suppose would provide greater
                        clarity? A chronological
                        structure, or a division of each
                        excavation's findings into various
                        sociological, religious, and
                        environmental sub-groupings?


                                        TROI
                        I thought you had already decided
                        on a chronological structure.


                                        PICARD
                        Still, there is something to be
                        said for a more scientific
                        approach.


                                        TROI
                        Captain, may I make a suggestion?


                                        PICARD
                        By all means.




                                        TROI
                        Relax! You've written a brilliant
                        speech.


                                        PICARD
                        It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll
                        be addressing some of the greatest
                        scientific minds in the
                        Federation. Switzer,
                        Klarc-Tarn-Droth, McFarland.
                        Giants in the field of Archeology.
                        Next to them I'm nothing but an
                        enthusiastic amateur.


                                        TROI
                        I doubt they think of you as an
                        amateur... not when it comes to
                        the ruins of Tagus Three.


                                        PICARD
                        Well, I have done my homework...
                        I've examined the findings of
                        every archaeological expedition
                        conducted on the planet's
                        surface...


                                        TROI
                        It's unfortunate the Taguans no
                        longer allow outsiders to visit
                        the ruins.


                                        PICARD
                        Indeed. Especially since we still
                        know so little about their
                        origin...
                        Hopefully, I've been able to
                        construct some intriguing theories
                        of my own.


                                        TROI
                        I'm sure the council members will
                        agree that you have.


                                        PICARD
                
                        Your support is appreciated,
                        Deanna.


                        


ACT ONE SCENE TWO


PICARD'S QUARTERS


        The door OPENS. Picard ENTERS looking somewhat
        fatigued.


        The first thing he notices -- is a Horga'hn sitting
        on his desk. Picard looks at it, curious... where the
        hell did this thing come from? Then...


                                        VASH 
                        Bring back any memories?


        Picard turns to see VASH stepping out of the shadows
        near the door. For a moment he's taken completely
        off-guard.


                                        PICARD
                        Vash? How did you get in here?




                                        VASH
                        I came in through the window.


        Picard barely has the chance to regain his aplomb when
        she snakes an arm around him and they kiss. It's going
        to last awhile.


                                                                        


                                        PICARD
                        I had no idea you were a member
                        of the Archaeology Council.


        Vash only smiles.


                                        PICARD
                        You are a member?
                                (a beat)
                        Aren't you?


                                        VASH
                                (smiling)
                        More or less.


                                        PICARD
                        Why have you come to Tagus Three?


                                        VASH
                        To see you, of course.


                                        PICARD
                        Is that the only reason?


                                        VASH
                        Isn't it enough?


        She's moves closer to him. It's an intimate moment.


                                        PICARD
                                (smiling)
                        I wish I could believe you?


                                        VASH
                                (smiling right back)
                        I'd be disappointed if you did.
                                (a beat)
                        I really have missed you,
                        Jean-Luc.


        But before they can act on a mutual impulse the DOOR
        CHIMES. Picard waits until Vash steps away before
        answering.


                                        PICARD
                        Come.


        


                                        BEVERLY
                        I'm sorry I'm late...
                                (noticing Vash)
                        Oh, excuse me. I didn't know you
                        had company.


                                        PICARD
                        That's quite all right, Doctor.
                        Beverly Crusher allow me to
                        introduce Vash. A friend of mine
                        with the Archeology Council.


        The two women exchange greetings.


                                        BEVERLY
                                (to Vash)
                        I didn't mean to interrupt. The
                        Captain and I often have evening tea.


                                        VASH
                        Yes, Jean-Luc has told me all
                        about you.


                                        BEVERLY
                        Really? When was that?


                                        VASH
                        On Risa. Where we met.




                                        BEVERLY
                        I see.
                                (to Picard)
                        That must have been during your
                        vacation last year.


                                        PICARD
                        So it was.


                                        BEVERLY
                                (to Vash)
                        I'm surprised he never mentioned
                        you.


                                        VASH
                        So am I.




                                        VASH
                        Are you busy, Doctor?


                                        BEVERLY
                        Not at the moment.


                                        VASH
                        I was wondering, I would love to
                        see some more of this marvelous
                        ship...


                                        BEVERLY
                        I'd be delighted to show it to
                        you. If that's alright with you,
                        Jean-Luc.


                                        PICARD
                        Of course.


        But he doesn't seem thrilled at the prospect. As Vash
        passes him on the way out...


                                        VASH
                                (sotto voce)
                        Don't worry, I promise to behave
                        myself.


        Picard does not look reassured.


ACT ONE SCENE THREE
TEN FORWARD


        The lounge is only lightly populated at the moment.


        Riker is seated alone having a drink.


        Beverly and Vash ENTER.


                                        BEVERLY
                        And this is Ten Forward, where
                        the Council's welcoming reception
                        is to be held this afternoon.


                                        VASH
                        I couldn't think of a better
                        location.
                                
                        Tell me, does Jean-Luc come here
                        often?


                                        BEVERLY
                        No, not often.


                                        VASH
                        I didn't think so.


                                        BEVERLY
                        The Captain is a very private man.




                                        VASH
                        He certainly acted that way when
                        we first met.
                                (smiling)
                        But I managed to loosen him up.


                                        BEVERLY
                        Would you like something to drink?


                                        VASH
                        Please.


        Beverly walks over to the bar. Vash checks out the
        view from the window as Riker APPROACHES.


                                        RIKER
                        Eternity never looked so lovely.


                                        VASH
                        Excuse me?


                                        RIKER
                        I was referring to the view.
                        Eternity never looked so lovely.


                                        VASH
                        You must be Commander Riker.


                                        RIKER
                                (surprised)
                        I'm afraid you have me at a
                        disadvantage.


                                        VASH
                        I didn't mean to interrupt. I
                        believe you were about to tell
                        me that my eyes are as mysterious
                        as the stars.


        Riker is intrigued. How the hell did she know?


                                        RIKER
                        You're a Betazoid.


                                        VASH
                        Not at all. It's just that
                        Jean-Luc does quite a good
                        imitation of you.


                                        RIKER
                        He does?


        Beverly comes back with the drinks.


                                        BEVERLY
                        I see you two have met.


                                        RIKER
                        Not exactly.


                                        BEVERLY
                        Vash is a member of the Archeology
                        Council. And a friend of the
                        Captain.


                                        RIKER
                        So I've gathered.


                                        BEVERLY
                        They met during his visit to Risa.


                                        RIKER
                        On Risa?
                                (amused)
                        That must have been a better
                        vacation than he let on.


                                        VASH
                        You mean he never mentioned me
                        to you either?


                                        RIKER
                        Believe me, if he had, I would
                        have remembered.


                                        VASH
                                (a bit frustrated)
                        You'd think he'd have told someone
                        about me.


                                        COMPUTER VOICE
                        Doctor Crusher, please report to
                        Sickbay.




                                        BEVERLY
                        On my way.
                                (to Vash)
                        I'm afraid I won't be able to
                        finish up our tour.
                        Perhaps Commander Riker could fill
                        in for me.


                                        RIKER
                        It would be my pleasure.


        Beverly leaves. Riker and Vash head for the door.


                                        VASH
                        So you're the one who asked
                        Jean-Luc to buy the Horga'han.


                                        RIKER
                        That was me.


                                        VASH
                        Tell me Commander, do you collect
                        sexual fertility symbols?


                                        RIKER
                        I wouldn't call it a very large
                        collection.


        


ACT ONE SCENE FOUR   BRIDGE


        DATA and GEORDI at Science Station, WORF at Tactical.
        


        Riker and Vash EXIT the aft turbolift.


                                        RIKER
                        And that brings us to the Main
                        Bridge, the Command center of the
                        Enterprise, and the end of our
                        tour.


        He brings her over to the Science Station.


                                        RIKER
                        Vash, I'd like you to meet
                        Commander La Forge and Commander
                        Data...


        An exchange of greetings. Riker gestures over to Worf
        who looks on with disapproval.


                                        RIKER
                        And this is Lieutenant Worf.
                                (noticing Worf's scowl)
                        Something wrong, Lieutenant?


                                        WORF
                        Sir, I was not informed that
                        Council Members had been granted
                        bridge clearance.


                                        RIKER
                        I think we can make an exception
                        in this case, Mister Worf. Vash
                        is the Captain's guest.


                                        WORF
                                (finally)
                        Welcome aboard.


                                        VASH
                        Is this where Jean-Luc sits?


                                        RIKER
                        That's the big chair.


        To everyone's surprise she sits down in it. It
        provides a definite sense of power.


                                        VASH
                        I can see where being a starship
                        Captain does have its rewards.


                                        PICARD 
                        I'm glad you approve.


        All eyes turn to Picard who has just exited the Ready
        Room. Vash stands.


                                        VASH
                        Jean-Luc. Commander Riker was
                        just showing me the bridge.


                                        RIKER
                        Doctor Crusher was called to
                        Sickbay.


                                        PICARD
                        So, did you enjoy your tour?


                                        VASH
                        Very much.


                                        PICARD
                        Good.


        Another awkward moment.


                                        VASH
                        I guess I'll head back to my room
                        now and get ready for the
                        reception.


                                        PICARD
                        By all means.
                                
                        Well, I suppose I'll see you then.


                                        VASH
                        I look forward to it.


        She turns and makes the long walk back up the ramp to
        the turbolift.


                                        RIKER
                                (watching her go)
                        Fascinating woman.




                                        DATA
                        You find something humorous,
                        Geordi?


                                        GEORDI
                        Didn't you notice how ill-at-ease
                        the Captain seemed around Vash?


                                        DATA
                        Yes. However I see nothing
                        amusing in his hostility toward
                        her.


                                        GEORDI
                        That wasn't hostility, Data.
                                (off Data's look)
                        He likes her.
                                (a beat)
                        A lot.


        Still smiling, Geordi turns back to the science
        monitor. A puzzled Data is left pondering the
        intricacies of human relationships.


ACT ONE SCENE FIVE


TEN FORWARD


        The reception. COUNCIL MEMBERS mingle with the crew.
        A rather informal time is being had by all.


        Vash has cornered TROI over by a buffet table.


                                        VASH
                        I don't understand, I thought
                        being ship's counselor meant the
                        Captain confided in you.


                                        TROI
                        He does. When he feels it's
                        necessary.


                                        VASH
                        And he never spoke to you about
                        me?


                                        TROI
                        Not that I can recall.


                                        VASH
                        Not even a hint?


                                        TROI
                        You must understand, the Captain
                        is a very...


                                        TROI & VASH
                                (together)
                        Private man.


                                        VASH
                        I know...


        She spots Picard speaking with someone….


                                        VASH
                        Will you excuse me?


                                        TROI
                        Certainly.


        Vash walks off and passes by Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Data.


                                        WORF
                                (still watching Vash)
                        Nice legs.
                                (off Geordi's look)
                        For a human.


        Picard talking to a member of the council
                                        PICARD
                        I agree, the Vulcan excavations
                        on Tagus Three were extensive.
                        Unfortunately, they were confined
                        to the northeastern part of the
                        city.


        Vash appears at his elbow.


                                        VASH
                        Jean-Luc, we need to talk.




                                        PICARD
                                (to the council person)
                        Pardon me.


        He and Vash move to a private spot.


                                        PICARD
                        The reception seems to be a
                        success.


                                        VASH
                        Forget the reception for a moment.
                        How come you've never mentioned
                        me to your friends?


                                        PICARD
                        What would you have me tell them?


                                        VASH
                        Maybe that we met, for one thing.
                        That we had an adventure together.
                        Some fun...


                                        PICARD
                        I'm afraid that wasn't possible.


                                        VASH
                        Why not?


                                        PICARD
                        It would have
                        been... inappropriate.


                                        VASH
                        I wasn't expecting you to go into
                        any intimate details.
                                        PICARD
                        A Captain does not share his
                        personal feelings with his crew.


                                        VASH
                        Is that a Starfleet regulation?
                        Or did you make that one up
                        yourself?


                                        PICARD
                        I'm sorry if you're upset.


                                        VASH
                        And I'm sorry if my being here
                        embarrasses you.


        And with that she turns and walks away.




Act Two Scene One


        Picard walks past Riker


                                        RIKER
                        How was the reception?


                                        PICARD
                                (brusque)
                        Splendid.


        He EXITS into the Ready Room.




        Picard ENTERS and stops as he SEES -- Q


        seated at his desk dressed in a Starfleet uniform.


                                        Q
                        Jean-Luc! How wonderful to see
                        you again.


                        Well don't just stand there, say
                        something.


        Picard advances into the room.


                                        PICARD
                        Get out of my chair.


                                        Q
                        I was hoping for something more
                        along the lines of "Welcome back,
                        Q. It's a pleasure to see you
                        again old friend."


                                        PICARD
                        We are not friends.


                                        Q
                        You wound me, mon Capitain.


                        There, perhaps now your manners
                        will show some improvement.


                                        PICARD
                        What brings you here, Q? Have you
                        been banished from the Continuum
                        once again?


                                        Q
                        Hardly. They're still apologizing
                        to me for the last time.


                                        PICARD
                        Then what is it you want?


                                        Q
                        Must I always have a reason to
                        stop by. I was in the sector
                        and...
                                (Picard doesn't buy it)
                        Alright. You force a confession
                        from me. The truth is I have a
                        debt to settle.


                                        PICARD
                        A debt?


                                        Q
                        To you, Picard. And it gnaws at
                        me. It interferes with each day.


                                        PICARD
                        I have no idea what you're talking
                        about...


                                        Q
                        Without your assistance at our
                        last encounter, I never would
                        have survived. I would have taken
                        my own life but for you, Jean-Luc.


                                        PICARD
                        We all make mistakes.


                                        Q
                        Your good deed made possible my
                        reinstatement into the continuum.
                        And I resent owing you
                        anything... so I'm here to pay
                        up... what shall it be... tell
                        me and I'll be gone...


                                        PICARD
                        Just be gone. That will suffice
                        nicely.


                                        Q
                        No, it must be something...
                        something...
                                (searching)
                        ...constructive. My new word for
                        the day.


                                        PICARD
                        Some other time, all right?
                        Right now I have several things
                        to attend to.




                                        Q
                        Yes, your speech. I've read it.
                        I found it dull and pedantic.
                        Much like yourself.
                                (an idea)
                        I could help you with it.


                                        PICARD
                        No.


                                        Q
                        You've never actually been to the
                        ruins in Tagus Three, have you?


                                        PICARD
                        They've been sealed off for over
                        a century.


                                        Q
                        How can you write about what you
                        haven't seen?
                                (brightening)
                        I'll take you there!


                                        PICARD
                        Impossible. That would mean
                        breaking Taguan law.


                                        Q
                        Must you always be so ethical?
                                (thinking)
                        I suppose we could travel back
                        in time. You could see what Tagus
                        was like two billion years ago.
                        They really knew how to have fun
                        in those days.


                                        PICARD
                        I'm afraid my answer is still no.
                        My lecture will have to stand on
                        its own. Now, will you please
                        leave my ship.


                                        Q
                        Then you refuse my help?




                                        PICARD
                        Completely.


        A beat as Q broods. Then finally...


                                        Q
                                (mildly)
                        You're simply impossible to find
                        a gift for, Picard.


        And he's gone.


                                        PICARD
                                (to Conn)
                        Commander Riker, report to my
                        Ready Room.


        Riker ENTERS.


                                        RIKER
                        Yes, Captain?


                                        PICARD
                        I've just been paid a visit by
                        Q.


                                        RIKER
                        Q?
                                (concerned)
                        Any idea what he's up to?


                                        PICARD
                        He wants to do something nice for
                        me.




                                        RIKER
                        I'll alert the crew.


        


Act Two Scene Two. CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER


        Picard EXITS the turbolift. He heads down the Corridor
        on the way to meet with one of the Council Officials.
        At the hall he hesitates, turns left instead of right.


        Picard HALTS at a doorway. RINGS the bell.


                                        VASH (V.O.)
                        Who's there?


                                        PICARD
                        It's me.


                                        VASH (V.O.)
                        Who?


                                        PICARD
                        Jean-Luc.


        The door slides open. Vash stands in the entrance.


                                        VASH
                        Yes.


                                        PICARD
                        May I come in?


                                        VASH
                        What for?


                                        PICARD
                        To talk.


                                        VASH
                        I'm listening.


                                        PICARD
                        If it's all the same to you I'd
                        rather this discussion not take
                        place in a public corridor.


        He slips past her.




        The first thing Picard notices are various digging
        tools piled in a corner. He looks over at Vash.


                                        VASH
                        I thought these were "private"
                        quarters.


        Picard picks up a PADD off the table.


                                        PICARD
                        And I thought I was the only
                        reason you came to Tagus.


                                        VASH
                        I never fooled you for a second.


        She moves closer to Picard.


                                        VASH
                        Still, you are the most important
                        reason.


                                        PICARD
                        Am I?


        Vash steps away.


                                        VASH
                        That's the trouble with being such
                        a well known liar. Even when I
                        tell the truth no one believes
                        me.


        Picard refuses to be swayed.


                                        PICARD
                        I'm afraid all this equipment will
                        have to be confiscated.


                                        VASH
                        Is that necessary?


                                        PICARD
                        I could have you placed in the
                        brig.


                                        VASH
                        Why don't you?


                                        PICARD
                        If the Taguans were to catch you
                        down there...


                                        VASH
                        You gave me the same warning about
                        Sarathong Five.


                                        PICARD
                        I remember.


                                        VASH
                        Well, it didn't stop me from going
                        there. I brought back some very
                        impressive artifacts, too.


                                        PICARD
                        Which you no doubt sold for a nice
                        profit.


                                        VASH
                                (angry)
                        It's what I do!


                                        PICARD
                        Not while you're aboard my ship.
                        I will not allow it.


                                        VASH
                        Let's get one thing straight,
                        Picard. I can not change who
                        I am for you or anyone else.


                                        PICARD
                        Nor can I change who I am.


                                        VASH
                                (calmly)
                        Then we have nothing more to say
                        to each other.


                                        PICARD
                        So it would seem.


        Picard leaves. Vash sits. She's
        depressed and upset.


        Q's head APPEARS from the bulkhead behind her. He's
        obviously overheard their discussion and found it
        fascinating.




ACT TWO SCENE THREE PICARD'S QUARTERS 
        Picard ENTERS, disgruntled. He goes into his bedroom,
        which is dark. As he enters, Q appears


                                        Q
                        Sleeping alone tonight, Picard?


                                        PICARD
                        I'm in no mood for your
                        foolishness, Q.


                                        Q
                        I thought there was something
                        different about you. You seemed
                        tense, preoccupied. Somewhat...
                        smaller.
                                (a beat)
                        At first I thought it was that
                        horrible lecture of yours. But
                        I was mistaken.


                                        PICARD
                        Whatever game you want to play
                        will have to wait until tomorrow.


                                        Q
                        I had such hopes for you,
                        Jean-Luc. I thought you were a
                        bit more evolved than the rest
                        of your species. But now I
                        realize you're as weak as all the
                        others.
                                (a beat)
                        Still, it pains me to see the
                        great Picard brought down by a
                        woman.




                                        PICARD
                        What woman?


                                        Q
                        Don't play coy with me Captain.
                        I witnessed your little spat with
                        Vash. Nor will I soon forget that
                        look of misery on your face. The
                        pain. The anguish. If I didn't
                        know better I would have thought
                        you were already married.


                                        PICARD
                        You really must be bored, Q.
                        You're letting your imagination
                        run away with you.


                                        Q
                        This human emotion of Love is
                        a dangerous thing, Picard. You
                        are obviously ill equipped to
                        handle it. She's found a
                        vulnerability in you... a
                        vulnerability that I've wanted
                        to find for years. If I had known
                        this sooner, I would have arrived
                        as a female. Mark my words,
                        Jean-Luc, this is your Achilles
                        heel..


                                        PICARD
                        Believe what you wish.


                                        Q
                        You deny you care for this woman?


        Picard doesn't answer.


                                        Q
                        Believe me, Picard, I'd be doing
                        you a big favor if I simply turned
                        her into a Klabnian eel.


                                        PICARD
                                (very seriously)
                        Stay away from her, Q.


                                        Q
                        I only want to help... my debt
                        to you...


                                        PICARD
                                (interrupting)
                        ... is hereby nullified. I don't
                        want your help... your advice...
                        your favors... or for that matter
                        -- you. Can you understand that
                        once and for all?


                                        Q
                        You would have me stand idly by
                        while she leads you to your
                        destruction?


                                        PICARD
                        Yes!


                                        Q
                        As you wish.




ACT TWO SCENE FOUR. MEETING ROOM - NEXT MORNING


        As Picard and Riker ENTER...


                                        RIKER
                        Knock 'em dead, Captain.


        Picard nods and moves toward the podium; Riker toward
        the audience.


        As he steps up to the podium. He's waited for this
        moment a long time.


                                        PICARD
                        Ladies and gentlemen, members of
                        the Archeology Council. Welcome.
                        It is the mystery of Tagus Three
                        that brings us together today...
                        a mystery that has invited more
                        argument and deduction than the
                        best Sherlock Holmes or Dixon Hill
                        tale. Well, if you'll excuse the
                        conceit, you're about to hear my
                        own detective story.




        Suddenly, a hunting cap, with feather, appears on
        Beverly's head. As Troi attempts to point this
        phenomenon out to Beverly, a similar cap appears on her
        own head. They stare at each other in disbelief.


                                        PICARD (V.O.)
                        For several years, I have been
                        trying to unravel the secrets of
                        Tagus Three. Needless to say,
                        I have not succeeded.
                        However, I have, I believe,
                        turned up some new information,
                        that if nothing else, raises a
                        whole new set of mysteries that
                        I hope we can discuss during our
                        time togther.




        Riker reacts to the quarterstaff that appears in his
        hand; Geordi to the mandolin that appears in his.

                        There have been nine hundred and
                        forty-seven known Archaeological
                        excavations conducted on the
                        planet's surface.




Data finds himself wearing a cowl... and holding a leg
        of lamb.

                        Out of that number some
                        seventy-four are generally
                        considered to have revealed
                        findings of major importance.

                        twenty-two thousand years ago.




        who along with the rest of the theater audience is
        beginning to realize that something peculiar is going
        on.

                        The last was completed within
                        the last four hundred years.


        Suddenly he's dressed in a jerkin and cap of familiar
        Lincoln green. The audience REACTS. So does Picard.
        Then, as a yeoman's bow appears in his hand...


                                        PICARD
                        What the hell... !


        He VANISHES.


FOREST - DAY 
        Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Worf, Beverly and Troi all
        APPEAR at the same time... all dressed in period
        costume. Beverly and Troi wear men's clothing.
        Beverly also carries a sword; Troi a longbow and
        arrows. Data is bald except for a soupbowl fringe
        plastered to his forehead. Riker wears a yellow jerkin
        and carries his quarterstaff. Worf is dressed like a
        dandy and Geordi still holds his madolin.


        As they all react...


                                        PICARD
                                (raging)
                        Q!


                                        TROI
                        Is this Tagus Three?


                                        PICARD
                        I doubt there are many oak trees
                        on Tagus. No, my guess is this
                        is supposed to be Earth.
                                (off reactions)
                        Sometime around the twelfth
                        century. And this is England,
                        Sherwood Forest to be precise.
                        Or at least Q's re-creation of
                        it.


                                        RIKER
                        That explains these costumes.


                                        PICARD
                        Exactly, Number One.
                                (a beat)
                        Or should I say, John Little.


        Riker studies Picard to see if he's serious.


                                        BEVERLY
                        If he's Little John, that would
                        make you...


                                        PICARD
                        I know. Robin Hood.


        A beat as this sinks in.


                                        WORF
                        Sir, I protest. I am not a merry
                        man.


                                        DATA
                        On the contrary, Lieutenant Worf,
                        your clothing identifies you with
                        the character of Will Scarlett.
                        Just as Geordi's Mandolin suggests
                        he is Alan-A-Dale.


                                        RIKER
                        And you, Mister Data, bear a
                        striking resemblance to one Friar
                        Tuck.


                                        WORF
                        I will not play the fool for Q's
                        amusement.


        He takes off his cap, looks at it in disgust, and
        slams it on the ground.


                                        PICARD
                        You're quite right, Worf.
                                (loudly)
                        Do you hear that Q? You may as
                        well return us to our ship
                        immediately.


        They react to a horse's shrill whinny and turn to
        see...


        SIR GUY OF GISBOURNE enters


        Mounted on a sleek charger, sword drawn.


                                        SIR GUY
                        I have you at last, Robin Hood.


        As he charges at Picard...




        Worf draws his own sword to defend his Captain...


        Sir Guy rides past Worf, cutting him across the
        shoulder with his sword. Worf is ready to fight on,
        but... Suddenly an arrow slams into a tree next to
        Picard...




        Men at arts Coming over a nearby hill. Longbows at the ready.




        Three more arrows strike trees around them. Picard
        sees there's only one hope to escape.


                                        PICARD
                        Quick. Into the forest.


 WORF prepares to cover their retreat.


        Hanging back as the others disappear into the trees.


                                        PICARD
                        Mister Worf. That's an order.


        Worf follows Picard into the forest.




        A furious Sir Guy turns to his men, who search the
        underbrush.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Enough, you fools. We'll never
                        find them in the greenwood.


ACT THREE SCENE ONE: FOREST - A GLADE - DAY


        Picard and his crew are resting. He approaches Worf
        who is being tended to by Beverly (sans tricorder.)


                                        BEVERLY
                                (applying a makeshift
                                 bandage)
                        I've managed to stop the
                        bleeding.


        Q appears on horseback. He's garbed in the cloak and
        livery of the High Sheriff of Nottingham.


        An angry Picard approaches Q.


                                        PICARD
                        It's about time you showed up,
                        Q.


                                        Q
                        I'd prefer it if you addressed
                        me as His Honor the High Sheriff
                        of Nottingham.


                                        PICARD
                        We will not share in this
                        pointless fantasy of yours.


        Q dismounts.


                                        Q
                        Fine. Wait here and do nothing.
                        By mid-day tomorrow, you'll all
                        be safely back aboard your ship.
                        But you will have to accept the
                        consequences of your inaction.


                                        PICARD
                        What consequences?


                                        Q
                        What's the one thing Robin Hood
                        is famous for?




        A beat. Nobody answers. Then...


                                        GEORDI
                        Robbing from the rich to give to
                        the poor?


                                        Q
                        Besides that.

                        Are you referring to his rescue
                        of Maid Marian from Nottingham
                        Castle?


                                        Q
                        Right you are, Data.


        Q looks over at Picard with glee.


                                        Q
                        And it just so happens that Sir
                        Guy of Gisbourne has decreed that
                        Marian's head comes off tomorrow
                        at noon.

                                (grimly)
                        Vash.


        Q smiles. He's enjoying himself thoroughly.


                                        Q
                        The choice is yours my dear,
                        Robin. You can either take your
                        ease here within the sylvan glade
                        or risk your life to save a woman
                        you care nothing about.


                                        PICARD
                        My feelings toward Vash are
                        irrelevant. I'd attempt to save
                        any innocent life, as you well
                        know.


                                        Q
                        But what of your merry men? Are
                        you willing to put them in
                        jeopardy as well? Is Vash's life
                        worth losing hers or his or even
                        his... ?
                                (the last being Worf)
                        Though I admit he would make a
                        perfect throw rug at Nottingham
                        Castle.


                                        PICARD
                        Q, I ask you to end this now,
                        before anyone else gets hurt.


        Q swings up onto the horse.


                                        Q
                        Impossible. You see, I've given
                        this fantasy as you call it, a
                        life of its own. I don't know
                        how things will turn out anymore
                        than you do.
                                (a beat)
                        But of one thing I am certain.
                        If you dare set foot in Nottingham
                        Castle, blood will be spilled.


        He, and the horse vanish.




ACT THREE SCENE TWO: MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBERS - DAY


        A small, stark room in the tower; minimal furniture
        to include a wooden bench. Vash, dressed in Marian's
        virginal white, paces the floor. She's watched by her Servant.


                                        SERVANT
                        You'll wear yourself out with
                        all that pacing, M'lady.




                                        VASH
                        I told you to stop calling me
                        that. My name's Vash.


                                        SERVANT
                        My poor lamb, it's a brain
                        sickness you've got for sure.
                        Can't I get you something to ease
                        your suffering?


                                        VASH
                        I could use a drink.


                                        SERVANT
                        It wasn't spirits I was thinking
                        of M'lady.


        She picks up a wooden box.


                                        SERVANT
                        I have here some nice fresh
                        leeches to drain the fever.


        Vash looks into the box, makes a disgusted look and sound, and bats the box out of her hands.)
        


                                        VASH
                                Out.        


                                        SERVANT
(She picks up the box) But, M’lady. Those are the best leeches in the land! (She seems to have forgotten her line) They cost at least… twenty dollars (stage manager cues: shillings) shillings. Yes. Twenty shillings.


                                        VASH
                                 Get out.


        The servant rushes to the door, but before she can get
        there it opens and Sir Guy ENTERS.


                                        SERVANT
                        Oh, her mind's in an awful
                        turmoil, Sir Guy. (She holds the box at Sir Guy, who looks pissed and promptly bats the box out of her hands, and she picks it up)


                        


        Sir Guy stares at Vash with undisguised desire.


                                        VASH
                        Who the hell are you?


                                        SERVANT
                        M'Lady, everyone in Nottingham
                        knows, Sir Guy of Gisbourne.


                                        VASH
                        Sir Guy of what?


        Her Servant rolls her eyes towards heaven, and shaking
        her head hurries out of the room.


        Sir Guy closes the door behind her.




                                        SIR GUY
                        Do not mock me, Lady Marian. I'm
                        prepared to offer you one final
                        chance to change your mind.


        He grabs hold of her.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Will you marry me?


        Vash pulls away and slaps him across the face.




                                        SIR GUY
                                (coldly)
                        I see. Then the execution will
                        proceed as scheduled.


        Sir Guy turns to leave.


                                        VASH
                        What execution?


                                        SIR GUY
                                (turning back)
                        I warn you Marian, this pathetic
                        attempt at feigning madness will
                        not save your life.


                                        VASH
                                (shocked)
                        You mean I'm the one getting
                        executed?


        Though Vash is at a loss to explain how she came to be
        in this current predicament, a lifetime of adventure
        has honed her survival instincts to a razor's edge.


                                        VASH
                        Sir Guy, wait? Can't we talk this
                        over?
                                (a beat)
                        I admit, I haven't been myself
                        lately.
                                (flashing her best
                                 smile)
                        Perhaps we've both been acting
                        a bit hasty.


        She sits down on the bench. Pats the space next to
        her.


                                        VASH
                        Please.


        Sir Guy smiles. Delighted.


ACT THREE SCENE THREE: SHERWOOD FOREST DAY


        We hear bad mandolin playing in the background as crew practices arrows, fighting with swords etcetera. We HEAR
        the THWACK of impact. 
        Data enters with an arrow in his chest.


        Troi hurries over.


                                        TROI
                        Data, are you alright?


        A beat, as Data checks his systems.


                                        DATA
                        The arrow impacted just above
                        my sixth intercostal support,
                        penetrating my secondary
                        subprocessor.


        Data moves his arm up and down and in and out.


                                        DATA
                                (continuing)
                        Fortunately, none of my
                        biofunctions seem impaired.
        He exits




        Beverly is checking Worf's wound in the background
        as Geordi sits on a log strumming the mandolin... it
        sounds like fingernails on a blackboard.


        Worf gets up, crosses to Geordi, and takes the
        mandolin out of his hands. He walks over, and smashes
        it against a tree. Hands the neck back to Geordi.


                                        WORF
                        Sorry.


 Hedgehog crosses stage, Stage manager enters and takes it offstage.




        A relieved grin from Riker as he watches Picard buckle
        on his sword.


                                        RIKER
                        It's about time we got out of
                        here, sir.


                                        PICARD
                        Not we Commander. You and the
                        others are to wait here until I
                        return.


                                        RIKER
                        You're not planning to go after
                        her alone, are you?


        The others gather around.


                                        PICARD
                        This is not a mission. It's
                        personal, between Q and myself.
                        I don't want any of you involved.


                                        RIKER
                        But Captain...


                                        PICARD
                        You have your orders, Commander.
                        I expect you to follow them.


        With a final glance at his crew, Picard heads off
        towards Nottingham.




ACT FOUR SCENE ONE


 COURTYARD INSIDE WALLS OF CASTLE - NIGHT


        Vash and Sir Guy, looking surprisingly chummy as they
        approach from another part of the courtyard. She
        carries a bouquet of fresh-picked flowers. Sir Guy
        holds up a pomegranate. Vash smiles and demurely
        nibbles it. Marian’s nurse follows with a the box of leeches. 


        A suspicious Q approaches them.


                                        Q
                        Such benevolence, Sir Guy,
                        allowing the condemned prisoner
                        fresh air.


                                        SIR GUY
                        You're mistaken, Sheriff. Maid
                        Marian has consented to be my
                        wife.
SERVANT
Oh, Sherriff, my lady’s come back to her senses and decided to marry…. (she seems to have forgetten her line. Stage managers cues: Sir Guy of Gisborne). Sir Guy of Gisborne. But I’ve kept the leeches just in case she falls ill again. (she shoves them in Q’s face and he bats the box out of her hands, she picks up the box, looking defeated)


        Q looks at Vash in disbelief.


                                        Q
                        But that's impossible?


        Vash motions to a servant who approaches with a tray
        and two goblets of wine.


                                        VASH
                                (innocently)
                        Not at all. Though I admit a
                        maiden seldom has the opportunity
                        to win herself such a noble
                        husband.


        She takes a goblet from the tray and hands it to Sir
        Guy...


                                        SIR GUY
                        A toast to the most beautiful
                        bride-to-be in all of England.


        He goes to drink.


                                        Q
                        Hold there, Sir Guy.


        He knocks the goblet to the ground.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Have you taken leave of your
                        senses?


                                        Q
                        It could be poisoned. Some foul
                        scheme of Robin Hood. She's in
                        league with him still, I'll
                        warrant.


                                        VASH
                        Robin Hood?


        A beat as Vash absorbs this rather bizarre accusation.
        She has no choice but to bluff her way through it.


                                        VASH
                        Oh, Robin Hood... that was over
                        long ago.


                                        Q
                        Why, all of Nottingham knows you're
                        in love with him.


                                        VASH
                        That's a lie.
                                (to Sir Guy)
                        He... bewitched me. Put me under
                        some evil spell.


        Sir Guy gives her hand an encouraging pat.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Just as I suspected.
                                (to Q)
                        You can add sorcery to the list
                        of charges against that rogue.


                                        Q
                        But Sir Guy, if anyone has been
                        bewitched it's you.


        Sir Guy stands. His hand is placed firmly on the hilt
        of his sword.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Silence. Any further impudence
                        and it'll be your head on the
                        chopping block.
                                (a beat)
                        Guards, escort the Lady Marian
                        to her chamber.


                                        VASH
                                (standing)
                        But I'd much rather stay with you.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Of course you would, my child.
                        But I have important business to
                        discuss with the Sheriff.
                                (a beat; then dripping
                                 with implication)
                        And you must prepare for your
                        wedding.


                                        VASH
                        I count the hours.


        She kisses him. She allows herself to be led away, but
        not before her eyes flash him the promise of future
        delights.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Lovely creature.


                                        Q
                                (with grudging
                                 admiration)
                        She is intriguing.


        Q is determined not to allow his well-laid scheme go
        astray.


                                        Q
                        Sir Guy, perhaps it would be wise
                        to keep this wedding a secret for
                        now.


                                        SIR GUY
                        What are you babbling about?


                                        Q
                        You still hope to capture Robin
                        Hood, don't you?


                                        SIR GUY
                        I live for the moment.


                                        Q
                                (thinking of Picard)
                        Well, if he were to hear that
                        Marian's life was no longer in
                        danger, there would be no need
                        for him to come to Nottingham to
                        rescue her.


        Sir Guy slaps Q on the back.


                                        SIR GUY
                        By heavens, you're right. No word
                        of my wedding shall leave these
                        walls.
                        
                        What better way to celebrate a
                        marriage than with an execution.


        Sir Guy and Q share a chuckle, then go their separate
        ways.


                                        Q
                                (musing)
                        This could be fun.




ACT FOUR SCENE TWO MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT


        Vash paces around the room. Suddenly she stops.
        Listening to what could be a faint rustling of vines, is coming
        from outside her open window. She moves towards the
        embrasure, when SUDDENLY a hand APPEARS on the ledge.
        With a final GRUNT, Picard lifts himself through the
        window. Vash throws herself at him.


                                        VASH
                        Jean-Luc. Am I glad to see you.


        She throws herself into his arms, and kisses him.


                                        VASH
                        You would not believe what I've
                        been through. One minute I'm on
                        the Enterprise... the next thing
                        I know I'm here in Nottingham.
                        First, they're going to chop my
                        head off... and now I'm supposed
                        to marry someone named Sir Guy...
                        and everyone insists on calling
                        me Marian...


                                        PICARD
                        Yes, I know.


                                        VASH
                        You do? But how...


        For the first time she notices his outfit.


                                        VASH
                        You're Robin Hood?


                                        PICARD
                        My staff and I were brought here
                        by an old adversary of mine named
                        Q. I'll tell you the rest once
                        we're safe.


        He leads her towards the window.


                                        PICARD
                        Come, we don't have much time.


                                        VASH
                        Are the others outside?


                                        PICARD
                        They're waiting for us back in
                        Sherwood.


        That brings Vash to a quick stop.


                                        VASH
                        You mean you came alone?


                                        PICARD
                        Yes, now let's...


                                        VASH
                        What kind of plan is that?


                                        PICARD
                        An excellent one if you'd only
                        hurry up.


        But Vash refuses to budge.


                                        VASH
                        You do realize our lives are at
                        stake here.


                                        PICARD
                        Only too well.


                                        VASH
                        And this is the best strategy
                        you could come up with? One man
                        against an entire castle.


                                        PICARD
                        I suppose you know of a better
                        one.


                                        VASH
                        How about this? You go. I'll
                        stay here.


        She walks away from the window.


                                        PICARD
                        And do what?


                                        VASH
                        Marry Sir Guy if I have to.


                                        PICARD
                                (ironic)
                        That is brilliant.


                                        VASH
                        If there's a way to escape, I'll
                        find it, eventually. With my head
                        still attached.


                                        PICARD
                        You don't really expect me to
                        leave you here?


        He reaches for her. She pulls away.


                                        VASH
                        I can take care of myself.


                                        PICARD
                        Must you be so stubborn?


        Suddenly the door is flying OPEN and Sir Guy enters
        backed by a retinue of SOLDIERS.


                                        SIR GUY
                        There'll be no escape for you this
                        time, Robin Hood.


                                        PICARD
                                (to Vash)
                        Behind me.


        He steps in front of her and reaches for his sword.
        But Vash is quicker. She pulls the blade out of his
        scabbard and points it at his chest.


                                        VASH
                        You should have left while you
                        had the chance.


        Sir Guy advances on them, smiling.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Well done, my dear.


                                        VASH
                                (sweetly)
                        Consider it my wedding present
                        to you.


        The Guards lead Picard away.
        Picard and the Guards come down the stairs. He barely
        glances at a beaming Q as he's hurried away. Sir Guy
        follows behind.


                                        Q
                        Congratulations, Gisbourne. I
                        see you've snared the jackal.


                                        SIR GUY
                        It's Marian who deserves the
                        credit. Took him with his own
                        sword.


        On Q's astonished REACTION...


ACT FOUR SCENE THREE
MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
        Vash is seated at a table, writing feverishly. Her
        SERVANT ENTERS and scuttles across the room to her. She holds the box of leeches)


                                        SERVANT
                        You sent for me, M'Lady?


                                        VASH
                        You must take this letter to
                        Robin's men. (She bats the box out of Servant’s hand and puts the letter into them)


                                        SERVANT
                        You want me to go to Sherwood
                        Forest? At this time of night?


                                        VASH
                        You'll leave immediately.




                                        SERVANT
                                (glancing out the
                                 window)
                        But it's dark. I'll get lost.
                        Besides, it's not safe. What with
                        all them hedge robbers and worse
                        lurking about.


                                        VASH
                        Please, this is urgent.


                                        SERVANT
                        You ask me, you'd be better off
                        staying with Sir Guy. He's got
                        a (she seems to forget her line. Stage manager appears to cue her, but then she remembers!) future. Why you'll be living
                        in London before you know it.


                                        VASH
                        But you must go. Otherwise,
                        they're going to kill him.


        
the door SWINGS open. Servant  leaps up dropping the
        letter on the table as Q ENTERS. Servant leaves the room)


                                        VASH
                        How dare you come barging in here
                        this way!


                                        Q
                        I come to offer apologies for my
                        harsh words earlier. I had no
                        idea you were so ruthless. The
                        cold blooded way you betrayed
                        Robin was most impressive.


        Q is now standing right by the table. Vash forces
        herself not to glance down at the letter.


                                        VASH
                        That's most gracious of you.


                                        Q
                        I admit I was surprised...
                                (a beat)
                        Though perhaps not as surprised
                        as Jean-Luc.




        Now it's Vash's turn to be surprised.


                                        VASH
                        You're Q.


                                        Q
                                (bowing)
                        And you are a very interesting
                        woman.


        He notices the letter.


                                        Q
                        What's this?


        She tries to snatch it away.


                                        VASH
                        Give me that.


        But it's too late.


                                        Q
                        A letter to Riker?
                                (reading)
                        Quick... Come to Castle... Must save
                        Captain...
                                (cheerfully)
                        Why this is wonderful. Such
                        marvelous duplicity. You
                        certainly fooled Sir Guy. And
                        me as well.
                                (a shrewd glance at
                                 Vash)
                        I do believe you're worth further
                        study.


                                        VASH
                                (turning on the charm)
                        Am I?


                                        Q
                        Unfortunately, we won't have the
                        time.
                                (shouting)
                        Guards!


        They enter.


                                        Q
                        Take this traitor away.
                                (to Vash)
                        It appears there's going to be
                        a double execution.


        Vash is marched from the room.


        And as Q gloats over this latest turn of events:


             
  ACT FIVE  SCENE ONE                           


COURTYARD - THE NEXT DAY


        A CROWD has gathered to SEE the show. Sir Guy and
        Q sit together at a dais at one end of the courtyard.


        We HEAR VOICES coming
        down off-camera, drawing close.


                                        PICARD (V.O.)
                        My fault?


                                        VASH (V.O.)
                        Yes, your fault.


                                        PICARD (V.O.)
                        We'd have been safe in Sherwood
                        if you hadn't grabbed my sword.


        Picard and Vash, both wearing shackles, come into VIEW
        as they walk toward CAMERA...


                                        VASH
                        I grabbed it to prevent you from
                        being killed.


                                        PICARD
                        You should have never interfered.


                                        VASH
                        You were the one interfering.


                                        PICARD
                        I was trying to rescue you.


                                        VASH
                        Next time don't bother.


                                        PICARD
                        I won't.


        They come to a halt in front of the executioners block.
        Q steps forward to meet them.


                                        Q
                        Don't you two ever stop arguing?


        No response.


                                        Q
                        Tell me Picard, as you stand here
                        facing the termination of your
                        insect existence, do you see what
                        has led you to this end?
                                (beat, no reply)
                        Was she worth it?


                                        PICARD
                        Can we just get this over with.


                                        VASH
                                (hurt)
                        Are you implying I'm not worth
                        it?


        But Picard keeps his eyes fixed on Q.


                                        PICARD
                        Your game was for my benefit,
                        Q. She is innocent in all this.


                                        Q
                        She is many things, none of them
                        innocent.


                                        PICARD
                        Let her go.


                                        VASH
                        Jean-Luc, you do care.


                                        Q
                        A gallant gesture Picard. But
                        a futile one.
                                (a beat)
                        Farewell. I hope you'll both be
                        happy together.


        He moves aside as Sir Guy rises to his feet.


                                        SIR GUY
                                (to Picard & Vash)
                        You have been found guilty of
                        outlawry and high treason. Do
                        you have anything to say before
                        sentencing is carried out?




        Impassive stares from the prisoners.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Ready them for the block.


        The Guards remove the chains. Vash and Picard are kneeling at the block.


        A group of hooded monks have entered the courtyard.
        Beneath the hoods are Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data,
        Beverly and Troi


        taking in the scene in front of them. Worf reaches
        for the sword beneath his robe. Geordi lays a
        restraining hand on Worf's arm.


                                        GEORDI
                        Too many of them. We'd never
                        get to the Captain...


                                        RIKER
                        Data, we need a diversion. Now.


        Data opens his left arm, revealing the circuitry and
        blinking lights within. He pulls out three small
        components and fastens them together.


                                        DATA
                                (to Riker)
                        Please stand back, Commander.
                        Microfusion cells can be somewhat
                        dangerous under high
                        temperatures...


        Riker stands back. Data tosses the components into
        the Tinker's fire. Tinker’s fire is played by the stage manager with red ribbons. Stage manager flails red ribbons wildly and says “KABOOM”, everyone looks over and is distracted while the crew goes in. 


        Amidst the confusion that follows, Picard leaps to his
        feet and rams his elbow into the executioner's stomach,
        knocking him to the ground. Picard then grabs hold
        of one of his guards, and pulls his sword free of its scabbard


        Riker, Worf, Geordi, Troi, Beverly and Data (who has
        closed the panel on his arm) throw off their monk's
        robes.


                                        VOICES
                        It's the outlaws. Robin's band.


        Sir Guy unsheathes his sword.


                                        SIR GUY
                        Guards. Take Marian to the
                        tower.


        Vash whirls and punches one of her captors but two
        others drag her up the stairs.


        Picard SEES Vash being taken away and tries to follow.
        A guard tries to block him and is cut down.




        As our crew beats back the attacking soldiers.




        Picard comes face to face with Sir Guy.


                                        SIR GUY
                        I'll have you know I'm the
                        greatest swordsman in all of
                        Nottingham.


        A quick flurry of cuts and parries as they test each
        others skill.


                                        PICARD
                        That's very impressive.


        They engage again.


                                        PICARD
                        But there's something you should
                        know.


        A furious series of strikes ending with their swords
        crossed at the hilt, their faces inches apart.


                                        SIR GUY
                        And what would that be?


                                        PICARD
                        I'm not from Nottingham.


        He pushes Sir Guy away.
        Gradually Picard forces Sir Guy up the stairs leading
        to Marian's room. Sir Guy, panic building, takes a
        vicious cut at Picard's head. Picard ducks, thrusts
        upward, and stabs Sir Guy through the body.


        Sir Guy tumbles off the staircase. Picard exits 




ACT FIVE SCENE TWO


        Vash, listens to the SOUNDS of battle.


        Suddenly, the door SWINGS and Picard races in.


                                        VASH
                        Jean-Luc.


        She runs into his arms. Picard is fed up with all
        this, tosses the sword to the floor.


                                        PICARD
                                (shouting)
                        It's over, Q. Now get us out of
                        here.


        Q APPEARS in the room.


                                        Q
                                (applauding)
                        My compliments, Captain. I doubt
                        Robin Hood himself could have done
                        better.


                                        PICARD
                        If any of my people are hurt...


                                        Q
                        Sadly, they're all fine... but
                        the point is they could have been
                        killed, and you might have been
                        too... all for the "Love Of A
                        Maid." My debt to you is paid,
                        Picard, if you have learned how
                        weak and vulnerable you really
                        are... if you can finally see how
                        "Love" brought out the worst in
                        you...


                                        VASH
                        Nonsense. You're absolutely
                        wrong. It brought out the best
                        in him.
                                (to him, intimately)
                        His nobility, courage, self-sacrifice.
                        His tenderness.


                                        Q
                                (to Vash)
                        You're good. Very good.


                                        PICARD
                                (end of his patience)
                        Enough of this.


                                        Q
                        Indeed.


        He snaps his finger and Picard DISAPPEARS.


ACT FIVE SCENE THREE: MEETING ROOM 




        The room is empty. Picard, in uniform, suddenly
        APPEARS at the podium. Riker and the others APPEAR
        back in the audience, exactly where they were sitting
        before. All back in their Starfleet uniforms. They
        look around in confusion.


                                        RIKER
                        Everybody here?


                                        TROI
                        Where's Vash?


        Picard scans the room. No sign of her.


                                        PICARD
                        Computer, locate Council Member
                        Vash.


                                        COMPUTER (VOICE)
                        Council Member Vash is not aboard
                        the Enterprise.


        Off his look of concern...


ALL EXIT AS PICARD ENTERS READY ROOM




ACT FIVE SCENE FOUR


         Vash MATERIALIZES.


                                        VASH
                        Hello, Jean-Luc.


                                        PICARD
                                (smiling)
                        Well, this is a relief. I was
                        afraid that Q...


                                        VASH
                        There were a few things he wanted
                        to discuss with me.




                                        PICARD
                        I'm surprised he wasn't too busy
                        gloating over his victory.


                                        VASH
                                (beat)
                        He was right about one thing,
                        Jean-Luc. As ridiculous as it
                        was, his game did prove how much
                        you care.


                                        PICARD
                        I may not share my feelings with
                        my crew, but I do have them.


        A warm moment passes between them.


                                        VASH
                        I'm going to miss you, Picard.


                                        PICARD
                        I wouldn't be surprised if our
                        paths cross again.


                                        VASH
                        I'll see to it.


        They kiss.


                                        PICARD
                        So, where are you off to now?


                                        VASH
                        I haven't made up my mind.
                        Remind you of someone you know?


                                        PICARD
                                (amused in spite of
                                 himself)
                        As a matter of fact... yes.


                                        Q
                                (Materializes and speaks to Vash)
                        We are going to have fun. I'll
                        take you places no human could
                        ever hope to see.


                                        VASH
                                (to Picard)
                        Who can resist an offer like that?


        Picard sees there's no way to change her mind. He
        advances on Q.


                                        PICARD
                        As payment in full for your debt
                        to me, you will guarantee her
                        safety...


                                        Q
                        She will not be harmed, Jean-Luc.
                        I promise you that.


        Picard looks over at Vash. A silent farewell.


                                        Q
                        Well, aren't you going to kiss
                        her good-bye?


        Picard and Vash stare at him until he gets the hint.


                                        Q
                        Oh, all right.


        He VANISHES.


        Vash smiles at Picard.


                                        VASH
                        Well aren't you?


        A final kiss. Then Vash steps back.


                                        VASH
                        Goodbye, Jean-Luc.


        She VANISHES


Jean Luc takes a moment. End of Show.
