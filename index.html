        <p>
        Fifteen minutes before showtime, Actors will be <br>
        onstage as if it is backstage. Getting ready. <br>
        Maybe some mirrors and tables. Some might be doing <br>
        weird vocal or physical exercises. Actors will be <br>
        free to ad lib what they want until show time. But <br>
        don’t worry, just do what you need to do to be <br>
        ready.

        <p>
        The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.

                        I thought you'd want to know,<br>
                        Captain, the Council members have<br>
                        all been beamed aboard and<br>
                        assigned quarters.

                        Excellent.

                        It really is quite late, Captain.

                                        <dt>PICARD</dt>
                        <dd>
                        Tell me, Counselor, in regard<br>
                        to my lecture, which do you<br>
                        suppose would provide greater<br>
                        clarity? A chronological<br>
                        structure, or a division of each<br>
                        excavation's findings into various<br>
                        sociological, religious, and<br>
                        environmental sub-groupings?

                        <dd>
                        I thought you had already decided<br>
                        on a chronological structure.

                        Still, there is something to be<br>
                        said for a more scientific<br>
                        approach.

                        Relax! You've written a brilliant<br>

                        It needs to be. Tomorrow I'll<br>
                        be addressing some of the greatest<br>
                        scientific minds in the<br>

                        I doubt they think of you as an<br>
                        amateur... not when it comes to<br>
                        the ruins of Tagus Three.

                        Well, I have done my homework...<br>
                        I've examined the findings of<br>
                        every archaeological expedition<br>
                        conducted on the planet's<br>
                        surface...

                        It's unfortunate the Taguans no<br>
                        longer allow outsiders to visit<br>
                        the ruins.

                        Indeed. Especially since we still<br>
                        know so little about their<br>
                        origin...<br>
                        Hopefully, I've been able to<br>
                        construct some intriguing theories<br>
                        of my own.

                        I'm sure the council members will<br>
                        agree that you have.

<h2 id="a1s2">ACT ONE SCENE TWO</h2>

<h3>PICARD'S QUARTERS</h3>

        <p>
        The door OPENS. Picard ENTERS looking somewhat<br>
        fatigued.
        </p>

        <p>
        The first thing he notices -- is a Horga'hn sitting<br>
        on his desk. Picard looks at it, curious... where the<br>
        hell did this thing come from? Then...
        </p>

                                        <dt>VASH</dt>
                        <dd>
                        Bring back any memories?<br>
                        </dd>

        <p>
        Picard turns to see VASH stepping out of the shadows<br>
        near the door. For a moment he's taken completely<br>
        off-guard.
        </p>

                                        <dt>PICARD</dt>
                        <dd>
                        Vash? How did you get in here?
                        </dd>

                                        <dt>VASH</dt>
                        <dd>
                        I came in through the window.
                        </dd>

        <p>
        Picard barely has the chance to regain his aplomb when<br>
        she snakes an arm around him and they kiss. It's going<br>
        to last awhile.
        </p>

                                        <dt>PICARD</dt>

                        I had no idea you were a member<br>

        Vash only smiles.

                        Is that the only reason?

                        Isn't it enough?
                        </dd>

        <p>
        She's moves closer to him. It's an intimate moment.
        </p>

                                        <dt>PICARD</dt>
                        <dd>

                        I wish I could believe you?
                        </dd>

                                        <dt>VASH</dt>

                                </span>
                        I'd be disappointed if you did.

        <p>
        But before they can act on a mutual impulse the DOOR<br>
        CHIMES. Picard waits until Vash steps away before<br>
        answering.

                        That's quite all right, Doctor.<br>
                        Beverly Crusher allow me to<br>
                        introduce Vash. A friend of mine<br>

        At the hall he hesitates, turns left instead of right.

                        I thought there was something<br>
                        different about you. You seemed<br>
                        tense, preoccupied. Somewhat...<br>
                        smaller.

                        At first I thought it was that<br>

                        I had such hopes for you,<br>
                        Jean-Luc. I thought you were a<br>
                        bit more evolved than the rest<br>
                        of your species. But now I<br>

        Picard nods and moves toward the podium; Riker toward<br>
        the audience.

        As he steps up to the podium. He's waited for this<br>
        moment a long time.

                        Ladies and gentlemen, members of<br>
                        the Archeology Council. Welcome.<br>
                        It is the mystery of Tagus Three<br>
                        that brings us together today...<br>
                        a mystery that has invited more<br>
                        argument and deduction than the<br>
                        best Sherlock Holmes or Dixon Hill<br>
                        tale. Well, if you'll excuse the<br>
                        conceit, you're about to hear my<br>
                        own detective story.

        <p>
        Suddenly, a hunting cap, with feather, appears on<br>
        Beverly's head. As Troi attempts to point this<br>
        phenomenon out to Beverly, a similar cap appears on her<br>
        own head. They stare at each other in disbelief.

                        trying to unravel the secrets of<br>
                        Tagus Three. Needless to say,<br>
                        I have not succeeded.<br>
                        However, I have, I believe,<br>
                        turned up some new information,<br>
                        that if nothing else, raises a<br>
                        whole new set of mysteries that<br>
                        I hope we can discuss during our<br>

        Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Worf, Beverly and Troi all<br>
        APPEAR at the same time... all dressed in period<br>
        costume. Beverly and Troi wear men's clothing.<br>
        Beverly also carries a sword; Troi a longbow and<br>
        arrows. Data is bald except for a soupbowl fringe<br>
        plastered to his forehead. Riker wears a yellow jerkin<br>
        and carries his quarterstaff. Worf is dressed like a<br>
        dandy and Geordi still holds his madolin.

<h3>MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBERS - DAY</h3>

        <p>
        A small, stark room in the tower; minimal furniture<br>
        to include a wooden bench. Vash, dressed in Marian's<br>
        virginal white, paces the floor. She's watched by her <br>
        Servant.

        Vash and Sir Guy, looking surprisingly chummy as they<br>
        approach from another part of the courtyard. She<br>
        carries a bouquet of fresh-picked flowers. Sir Guy<br>
        holds up a pomegranate. Vash smiles and demurely<br>
        nibbles it. Marian’s nurse follows with a the box of leeches.

<h3>MAID MARIAN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT</h3>

        <p>
        Vash paces around the room. Suddenly she stops.
        </p>

        <p>
        Listening to what could be a faint rustling of <br>
        vines, is coming from outside her open window. <br>
        She moves towards the embrasure, when SUDDENLY a <br>
        hand APPEARS on the ledge.
        </p>

        <p>
        With a final GRUNT, Picard lifts himself through the<br>
        window. Vash throws herself at him.

        He steps in front of her and reaches for his sword.<br>

        scabbard and points it at his chest.

        The Guards remove the chains. Vash and Picard are <br>
        kneeling at the block.

        <p>
        A group of hooded monks have entered the courtyard.<br>
        Beneath the hoods are Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data,<br>
        Beverly and Troi
        </p>

        <p>
        taking in the scene in front of them. Worf reaches<br>
        for the sword beneath his robe. Geordi lays a<br>
        restraining hand on Worf's arm.

        Data opens his left arm, revealing the circuitry and<br>
        blinking lights within. He pulls out three small<br>
        components and fastens them together.

        <p>
        Riker stands back. Data tosses the components into<br>
        the Tinker's fire. Tinker’s fire is played by the <br>
        stage manager with red ribbons. Stage manager flails <br>
        red ribbons wildly and says “KABOOM”, everyone looks <br>
        over and is distracted while the crew goes in.

        <p>
        Amidst the confusion that follows, Picard leaps to his<br>
        feet and rams his elbow into the executioner's stomach,<br>
        knocking him to the ground. Picard then grabs hold<br>
        of one of his guards, and pulls his sword free of its <br>
        scabbard

        <p>
        Riker, Worf, Geordi, Troi, Beverly and Data (who has<br>
        closed the panel on his arm) throw off their monk's<br>
        robes.

        Gradually Picard forces Sir Guy up the stairs leading<br>

        vicious cut at Picard's head. Picard ducks, thrusts<br>
        upward, and stabs Sir Guy through the body.

        Picard sees there's no way to change her mind. He<br>
        advances on Q.

                        She will not be harmed, Jean-Luc.<br>
                        I promise you that.

        <p>
        Picard looks over at Vash. A silent farewell.
        </p>

                                        <dt>Q</dt>

                        her good-bye?

        <p>
        Picard and Vash stare at him until he gets the hint.

        <p>
        He VANISHES.
        </p>

        <p>
        Vash smiles at Picard.
        </p>

                                        <dt>VASH</dt>

                        Well aren't you?
                        </dd>

        <p>
        A final kiss. Then Vash steps back.
        </p>

        <p>
        She VANISHES
        </p>

        <p>
        Jean Luc takes a moment. 
        </p>

        <p>
        End of Show.
